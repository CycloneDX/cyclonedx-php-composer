# Demo: local

This is a demo of how locally hosted/located requirements are treated.

The demo is intended to run on every environment.
This demo creates non-reproducible outcome.

## Example results

The following are examples generated by _cyclonedx-php-composer_:

* [`example-results/bom.xml`](example-results/bom.xml)
* [`example-results/bom.json`](example-results/bom.json)

## Setup

For the sake of a demo, a relative path to the _cyclonedx-php-composer_ project is used,
so the current code is symlinked and taken into action.

To get the setup up and running, run from the demo directory:

```shell
composer -dproject update
```

## Usage examples

Run one of these from the demo directory:

* See _cyclonedx-php-composer_ help page:
  ```shell
  composer -dproject make-bom --help 
  ```
* Make XML sbom:
  ```shell
  composer -dproject make-bom --exclude-dev --output-format=XML  --output-file="$PWD/example-results/bom.xml"
  ```
* Make JSON sbom:
  ```shell
  composer -dproject make-bom --exclude-dev --output-format=JSON --output-file="$PWD/example-results/bom.json"
  ```
