# Demo: symfony

*ATTENTION*: this demo might use known vulnerable dependencies for showcasing purposes.

The output is *reproducible*, due to the [shipped composer-locked](project/composer.lock) versions.  
Therefore, the demo requires a special php environment, which is caused by the composer-requirements:

## Example results

The following are examples generated by _cyclonedx-php-composer_:

* [`results/bom.1.1.xml`](results/bom.1.1.xml)
* [`results/bom.1.2.xml`](results/bom.1.2.xml)
* [`results/bom.1.3.xml`](results/bom.1.3.xml)
* [`results/bom.1.4.xml`](results/bom.1.4.xml)

## Setup

For the sake of a demo, a relative path to the _cyclonedx-php-composer_ project is used,
so the current code is symlinked and taken into action.

To get the setup up and running, run from this demo directory:

```shell
composer -d project setup
```

## Usage examples

Run one of these from the demo directory:

* See _cyclonedx-php-composer_ help page:

  ```shell
  composer -d project CycloneDX:make-sbom --help 
  ```

* Make XML sbom via composer script:

  ```shell
  composer -d project create-sbom-results:XML"
  ```

* Make JSON sbom via composer script:

  ```shell
  composer -d project create-sbom-results:JSON
  ```
