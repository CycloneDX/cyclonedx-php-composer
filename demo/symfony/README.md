# Demo: symfony

The demo is intended to run on every environment.

This also means, the output might not be reproducible on independent systems,
due to the fact that version-locks are fluid, and the composer-lock file is not sipped as code.

## Example results

The following are examples generated by _cyclonedx-php-composer_:

* [`example-results/bom.xml`](example-results/bom.xml)
* [`example-results/bom.json`](example-results/bom.json)

## Setup

For the sake of a demo, a relative path to the _cyclonedx-php-composer_ project is used,
so the current code is symlinked and taken into action.

To get the setup up and running, run from this demo directory:

```shell
composer -dproject setup
```

## Usage examples

Run one of these from the demo directory:

* See _cyclonedx-php-composer_ help page:

  ```shell
  composer -dproject make-bom --help 
  ```

* Make XML sbom via composer script:

  ```shell
  composer -dproject create-sbom-results:XML"
  ```

* Make JSON sbom via composer script:

  ```shell
  composer -dproject make-bom create-sbom-results:JSON
  ```
