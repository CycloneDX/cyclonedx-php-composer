# Demo

This includes a demo project, which composer-requires `symfony/symfony` in a stable version.

Purpose is to demonstrate how _cyclonedx-php-composer_ integrates, is used 
and how the generated output will look like.

## Example results

the following are examples generated by _cyclonedx-php-composer_:

* [`results/bom.xml`](results/bom.xml)
* [`results/bom.json`](results/bom.json)

## Setup 

For the sake of a demo, a relative path to the _cyclonedx-php-composer_ project is used,
so the current code is symlinked and taken into action.

To get the setup up and running, run from the demo directory: 

```shell
composer -dproject update
```

## Usage examples

### In place 

_Requires composer2_

Run one of these from the demo directory:

* See _cyclonedx-php-composer_ help page:  
  ```shell
  composer -dproject make-bom --help 
  ```
* Make XML sbom:  
  ```shell
  composer -dproject make-bom --exclude-dev --output-file=$PWD/results/bom.xml
  ```
* Make JSON sbom:
  ```shell
  composer -dproject make-bom --exclude-dev --json --output-file=$PWD/results/bom.json
  ```

### In a temp dir

You might want to run the demo in a temporary directory.  
You might be forced to do so, if you are using composer1 instead of composer2.

TO do this, run the following from this directory:

```shell
DEMO_TEMP_DIR_PATH="$( project/temp_setup-helper.sh )"
composer -d"$DEMO_TEMP_DIR_PATH" install
# run the demos like tis:
composer -d"$DEMO_TEMP_DIR_PATH" make-bom --help
```
