# Plugin integration test

here is a small template script, which will create 
a dummy project in the directory you are calling it from.
This dummy project utilizes this very composer plugin.

The dummy will also install a full symfony, just for demo purposes,
If run with `composer install` and `composer make-bom` in there.
