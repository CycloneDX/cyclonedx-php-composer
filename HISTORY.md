* 2.1  – Added Support for CycloneDX 1.4 (via [#250])
* 2.3  – SBOM has a unique identifier ([#279] via [#250], [#353])
* 2.7  – SBOM is timestamped ([#112] via [#250])
* 2.9  – Accuracy of Inventory was improved  ([#102], [#122], [#261], [#313] via [#250])
* 2.10 – Accuracy of Inventory of all test components was improved ([#102], [#122], [#261], [#313] via [#250])
* 2.11 – SBOM metadata was enhanced ([#171] via [#250])
* 2.15 – SPDX license expression detection fixed ([#128] via [#250])

* Legal
  * Transferred copyright to OWASP Foundation. (via [#244])

[#244]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/244

## 3.10.1 - 2022-08-16

* Maintenance release.

## 3.10.0 - 2022-04-02

* Changed
  * Raised dependency `cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library:^1.4.2`, was `cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library:^1.3.1`. (via [#192])
* Misc
  * Adjusted internal typing and typehints. (via [#192])
  * Improved compatibility to Composer v2.3 (via [#212])

[#192]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/192
[#212]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/212

## 3.9.2 - 2021-12-04

* Fixed
  * ExternalReferences fetched from composer's `support.email` are correctly prefixed with "mailto:". (via [#161])  
    Value was unmodified in the past.

[#161]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/161

## 3.9.1 - 2021-12-03

* Fixed
  * XML validation error for ExternalReference. ([#158] via [#159])
* Changed
  * The `ValidationError` message requests reporting with the "ValidationError" issue template. (via [#160])  
    No template was used in the past.

[#158]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/issues/158
[#159]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/159
[#160]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/160

## 3.9.0 - 2021-12-01

* Added
  * The resulting SBoM hold ExternalReferences as fetched from package descriptions. (via [#145])

[#145]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/145

## 3.8.0 - 2021-11-30

* Fixed
  * Compatibility with composer v2.0.0 to v2.0.4 was improved. (via [#152])
  * Possible crashes when composer was not able to detect component's version properly.

[#152]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/152

## 3.7.0 - 2021-11-10

* Added
  * CLI got a new switch `--no-version-normalization`. (via [#138])  
    That allows to omit component version-string normalization.  
    Per default this plugin will normalize version strings by stripping leading "v".  
    This is a compatibility-switch. The next major-version of this plugin will not modify component versions. (see [#102])

[#138]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/138
[#102]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/issues/102

## 3.6.0 - 2021-10-15

* Added
  * CLI got a new option `--mc-version`. (via [#133])  
    That allows to set the main component's version in the resulting SBoM,
    so that the auto-detection can be overridden.
* Fixed
  * The resulting SBoM's main component's `purl` does not get a version assigned,
    if the version auto-detection fails. (via [#134])

[#133]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/133
[#134]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/134

## 3.5.0 - 2021-10-07

* Changed
  * Core library
    * Was moved to an own package: <https://packagist.org/packages/cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library>  
      The new external package/library is a one-to-one copy of the original code from this project.  
      The new external package/library is a dependency/required of this project. So usage/leverage of the original code is still possible without any changes for third parties.  
      See [#87] for details.

[#87]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/issues/87

## 3.4.1 - 2021-09-16

* Fixed
  * Improved compatibility to composer. (via [#125])  
    This was made possible since composer's type hints are getting fixed.  
    See <https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.1.7>  
    > Added many type annotations internally, which may have an effect on CI/static analysis for people using Composer as a dependency.

[#125]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/pull/125

## 3.4.0 - 2021-09-12

* Changed
  * Core library
    * Some repository data-types are lists of unique items, so no duplicates are kept.  
      Affected classes/data-types:
      * `ComponentRepository`
      * `DisjunctiveLicenseRepository`
      * `ToolRepository`
* Added
  * CLI via `composer make-bom`
    * Will try to populate dependencies of the SBoM result.
  * Core library
    * Added `BomRef` model to link bom elements in general.  
      Added `BomRefRepository` data type as a collection of unique `BomRef`.
    * Added bomRef to `Component` model to link components as dependencies.  
      Added dependencies to `Component` model.
    * Added ability to serialize `dependencies` to XML.
    * Added ability to serialize `dependencies` to JSON.
* Misc
  * Moved development docs to [`docs/dev/`](docs/dev).
  * Refactored the plugin's internals.

## 3.3.1 - 2021-07-29

* Fixed
  * CLI via `composer make-bom`
    * Will ignore "AliasPackages" when generating the SBoM, since their alias-target is part of the SBoM already.

## 3.3.0 - 2021-07-25

* Changed
  * Core library
    * SerializersGroups will skip unsupported elements silently, instead of forwarding caught exceptions.  
      This results in an overall smoother SBoM generation process, just as intended.
* Added
  * CLI via `composer make-bom`
    * Will try to populate metadata of the SBoM result.
  * Core library
    * Added models for spec elements: `metadata`, `tools`, `tool`
    * Added ability to serialize `metadata` to XML.
    * Added ability to serialize `metadata` to JSON.
* Fixed
  * CLI via `composer make-bom`
    * composer packages of type `project` or `composer-plugin`
      result as CycloneDX component of type `application`, was `library`.
* Misc
  * Updated demos/examples to reflect current state of SBoM results including metadata.
  * Split some tests to more fine-grained scenarios.

## 3.2.0 - 2021-07-19

* Changed
  * CLI via `composer make-bom`
    * All informational/error output will appear on _STDERR_, was _STDOUT_.
      Output of the SBoM might still happen on _STDOUT_.  
      This makes utilization of _STDOUT_ via `--output-file=-` more flexible (pipe, redirect)
      whilst verbosity can be increased via `-v`.
* Added
  * CLI via `composer make-bom`
    * Added an optional argument `composer-file`.  
      If given, then the SBoM is generated based on that file instead of the file in the current working directory.  
      This enables the plugin to analyze projects outside the plugin's own setup.
* Fixed
  * Fixed detection of invalid/outdated composer lock file.
  * Fixed a rare case that caused the CLI to crash unexpectedly, if the composer lock file was unexpected.
* Misc
  * Added composer keywords.
  * Refactored the plugin's internals.
  * Added more tests for internals.

## 3.1.1 - 2021-07-13

* Misc
  * Updated some documentation.
  * Bumped some dev-tools.
  * Added normalizer for `composer.json` files.

## 3.1.0 - 2021-07-13

* Added
  * CLI via `composer make-bom`
    * Per default the command will validate the resulting SBoM before writing it to file/stdOut.
    * Added a switch `--no-validate` to disable result validation.
    * When the verbosity at "debug" level, then detailed debug info will be put out.
      This should help to find validation issues.
  * Validation classes/methods to test SBoM
    in XML and JSON format
    for spec 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

## 3.0.0 - 2021-07-05

* Breaking Changes
  * Now requires php `^7.3 || ^8.0`, was `^7.1 || ^8.0`.
  * Now requires composer v2 - `composer-plugin-api:^2.0`, was `composer-plugin-api:^1.1||^2.0`.
  * CLI via `composer make-bom`
    * Now defaults to the latest supported version of CycloneDX spec: 1.3  
      See option `--spec-version`.
    * Deprecated switch `--json` was removed.  
      Use option `--output-format=JSON` instead.
  * Component's license in SpdxLicenseExpression format is no longer split into disjunctive licenses.
    Still using licenses properly in the resulting output file.
  * Complete rewrite/refactor.  
    Expect library classes/methods/functions to be removed, renamed or incompatible to previous versions - see the source for changes.
* Added
  * CLI
    * Output is less verbose per default. Can be increased via `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`.
    * Support for output to _STDOUT_. Use option `--output-file=-`.
    * Added an optional option `--spec-version` for the CycloneDX spec version.  
      Supported values: "1.1", "1.2", "1.3".  
      Defaults to "1.3".
  * Support for JSON output format.  
    JSON support was a preview before and became a basic part of the plugin now.
* Removed
  * This plugin no longer supports `php<7.3`.
  * This plugin no longer supports composer v1.
  * CLI
    * Deprecated switch `--json` was removed.  
      Use option `--output-format=JSON` instead.
* Fixed
  * Some cases when the JSON SBoM generator created schema-invalid data.
* Misc
  * Utilize [`package-url/packageurl-php`](https://packagist.org/packages/package-url/packageurl-php)
    over own implementation.
  * Added more tests during the build process.
  * Added [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) & [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://cs.symfony.com/) to the CI chain and fixed all findings accordingly.
  * Added a demo run of the plugin to the CI chain.

## 2.1.0 - 2021-05-24

* Added
  * CLI got an option `--output-format` to decide the output format. (via [#80])
