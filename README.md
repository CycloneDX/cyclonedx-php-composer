# CycloneDX PHP Composer Plugin

A plugin for PHP's [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
that generates Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) in [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) format.

## Requirements

The latest version of this plugin
supports PHP `^7.3||^8.0`
with Composer `^2.0`
.

There are older versions of this plugin available, which
support PHP `^5.5||^7.0||^8.0`
with Composer `^1.0||^2.0`
.

## Installation

Install globally via composer:

```shell
composer global require cyclonedx/cyclonedx-php-composer
```

Also supports local install via:

```shell
composer require --dev cyclonedx/cyclonedx-php-composer
```

## Usage

After successful installation, the composer command `make-bom` is available.

```text
$ composer make-bom -h
Usage:
  make-bom [options] [--] [<composer-file>]

Arguments:
  composer-file                      Path to composer config file.
                                     Defaults to "composer.json" file in working directory.

Options:
      --output-format=OUTPUT-FORMAT  Which output format to use.
                                     Values: "XML", "JSON" [default: "XML"]
      --output-file=OUTPUT-FILE      Path to the output file.
                                     Set to "-" to write to STDOUT.
                                     Depending on the output-format, default is one of: "bom.xml", "bom.json"
      --exclude-dev                  Exclude dev dependencies
      --exclude-plugins              Exclude composer plugins
      --spec-version=SPEC-VERSION    Which version of CycloneDX spec to use.
                                     Values: "1.1", "1.2", "1.3" [default: "1.3"]
      --no-validate                  Don't validate the resulting output
      --mc-version=MC-VERSION        Version of the main component.
                                     This will override auto-detection.
      --no-version-normalization     Don't normalize component version strings.
                                     Per default this plugin will normalize version strings by stripping leading "v".
                                     This is a compatibility-switch. The next major-version of this plugin will not modify component versions.
  -h, --help                         Display this help message
  -q, --quiet                        Do not output any message
  -V, --version                      Display this application version
      --ansi                         Force ANSI output
      --no-ansi                      Disable ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction               Do not ask any interactive question
      --profile                      Display timing and memory usage information
      --no-plugins                   Whether to disable plugins.
  -d, --working-dir=WORKING-DIR      If specified, use the given directory as working directory.
      --no-cache                     Prevent use of the cache
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose               Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug
