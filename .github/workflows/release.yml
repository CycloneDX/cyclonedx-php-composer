# This workflow is used for publishing releases.
#
# Before triggering a release the `../../semver.txt` file should be updated in the
# relevant branch.
#
# Before triggering a major release or when planning a switch:
# follow the instructions in `../../docs/dev/processes/major_version_switch.md`.
#
# When committing the version change in `semver.txt` the commit message is
# important as it will be used for the release in GitHub.
#
# For an example commit browse to
# https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-dotnet/commit/d110af854371374460430bb8438225a7d7a84274.
#
# The resulting release is here
# https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.0.0.
#
# Releases are triggered manually. This can be done by browsing to
# https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease
# and selecting "Run workflow". If releasing a patch for a previous version
# make sure the correct branch is selected. It will default to the default
# branch.
